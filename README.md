A matrix decomposition (or factorization) is the process of breaking down a
given matrix into a product of two or more simpler matrices.

Following are the different techniques of matrix decompositions:

- LU Decomposition
- QR Decomposition
- Cholesky Decomposition
- Eigen Decomposition
- Singular Value Decomposition
- Jordan Decomposition
- Polar Decomposition
- Schur Decomposition
